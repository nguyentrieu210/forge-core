## v1.0.0 additions

- Bounded Bank Transaction and Bank Reconciliation engine with partial matching, reversal and commit-time over-reconciliation guard.
- Salary Slip accounting with server-owned Salary Component accounts, employee payable and Payment Ledger.
- Payroll Entry grouping with commit-time prevention of including one Salary Slip in multiple active payroll runs.

- Provider-derived E-Invoice Submission queue records bound to a submitted Sales Invoice or Credit Note, with one active submission per source.
- CRM and portal metadata foundations for Lead, Opportunity and Portal User.
- Bank Reconciliation Summary, Payroll Register, Subscription Schedule and E-Invoice Submission Log reports.

## Honest boundaries

- Bank reconciliation is a bounded manual matching engine; statement import connectors, fuzzy auto-matching and bank-specific integrations remain open.
- Payroll covers Salary Slip accounting and Payroll Entry grouping, not attendance, leave, tax, benefits, loans, payroll payment automation or statutory payroll filing.
- Subscription computes schedules but does not run a scheduler that automatically creates and submits invoices.
- E-invoice support is an audited provider queue seam, not a certified country implementation or legal authorization.
- CRM and portal remain metadata foundations; complete selling CRM, website, customer/supplier portal and self-service flows remain open.
- Financial statements remain bounded account summaries; consolidation and complete fiscal close parity remain open.
- Full Python/Frappe app compatibility, complete MRP/subcontracting, full HR lifecycle and complete regional statutory packs remain outside this release.
- Production promotion requires exact-artifact Linux dependencies, Workerd/Vite, pinned oracle replay, staging, load/security, legal review, rollback and tenant restore evidence.
